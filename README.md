# Stroke_Prediction_Using_Machinelearning
A simple and interactive web application that predicts the likelihood of a stroke using machine learning. Built with Flask and powered by a trained model, this project enables users to enter basic health and demographic information to assess stroke risk.

ðŸš€ Project Overview
Strokes are a leading cause of death globally, and early detection is key to prevention and treatment. This web app allows users to input medical and personal data to predict whether they are likely to suffer from a stroke.
The prediction is made using a machine learning model trained on healthcare data, and the app is designed with simplicity and accessibility in mind using Bootstrap for the frontend.
